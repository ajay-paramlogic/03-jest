# Mocking

## The importance of mocking in testing

Mocking is a crucial technique in testing, as it allows you to replace complex, external dependencies or parts of your code with simplified, controllable versions. By using mocks, you can isolate the code you want to test, ensuring that the tests focus on the behavior of that specific piece of code. This results in faster, more reliable, and easier-to-maintain tests.

## Using Jest's built-in mocking capabilities

Jest comes with built-in mocking capabilities, allowing you to create mock functions, modules, and dependencies easily. This helps you keep your tests focused on the code you're testing and prevents external factors from affecting the results.

## Creating mock functions with `jest.fn()`
You can create mock functions using `jest.fn()`. These functions can have their behavior customized and their calls tracked, making it easier to test how they interact with other parts of your code.

```js
const mockFunction = jest.fn();

// Customizing the mock function's behavior
mockFunction.mockReturnValue('Mocked value');

// Using the mock function
const result = mockFunction();

// Testing the mock function
expect(mockFunction).toHaveBeenCalled();
expect(result).toEqual('Mocked value');
```

## Mocking modules and dependencies

Jest allows you to mock entire modules and dependencies using the `jest.mock()` function. This is useful for isolating your tests from external dependencies or replacing a module with a simpler version for testing purposes.

```js
// Mocking a dependency
jest.mock('./myDependency');

// Importing the mocked dependency
import { myFunction } from './myDependency';

// Using the mocked dependency
const result = myFunction();

// Testing the mocked dependency
expect(myFunction).toHaveBeenCalled();
expect(result).toEqual('Mocked result');
```

## Spying on functions with `jest.spyOn()`

Jest provides the `jest.spyOn()` function, which allows you to spy on a function's calls without affecting its original behavior. This is helpful when you want to ensure that a function is called correctly without modifying its implementation.

```js
import { myFunction, myDependency } from './myModule';

// Spying on a function
const spy = jest.spyOn(myDependency, 'myFunction');

// Using the function
myFunction();

// Testing the function call
expect(spy).toHaveBeenCalled();

// Restoring the original function
spy.mockRestore();
```
